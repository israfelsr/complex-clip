## 1. General Alignment Benchmarks
To evaluate general alignment, we utilize the following datasets:
- COCO and Flickr Retrieval: Common datasets for image captioning and image-text retrieval tasks, featuring images paired with descriptive captions.
- CIFAR-10: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- CIFAR-100: Similar to CIFAR-10, but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
- ImageNet: A large-scale dataset of images organized according to the WordNet hierarchy, primarily used for image classification.

## 2. Compositionality Benchmarks
For evaluating compositionality, our benchmark incorporates the following dataset:

- Winoground
- SugarCrepe++ (SC++)

Winoground can be easily downloaded using the Hugging Face datasets library. Ensure you have the library installed.
